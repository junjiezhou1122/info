# View Implementation Matrix

This matrix tracks whether each View type is only described, registered in the
runtime catalog, produced by code, and surfaced in the current UI.

Status legend:

- **Runtime-ready**: queryable and produced by the current runtime/compiler/program path.
- **Spec-ready**: defined in `@info/view-system` and has a processor or handler shape, but is not fully wired into the main runtime catalog/UI path.
- **Modeled**: appears as a target or durable memory type, but does not yet have a mature direct producer.
- **Alias**: overlapping old/new naming exists but is retained only as compatibility metadata while canonical names are migrated.
- **Missing**: no meaningful implementation found beyond incidental mentions.

Key sources:

- `packages/views/catalog.ts`: current HTTP/UI runtime family catalog.
- `packages/view-system/builtins.ts`: newer open ViewSpec registry.
- `packages/views/processors.ts`: current view compiler worker definitions.
- `packages/processor-runtime/builtins/*`: processor-runtime producers.
- `packages/programs/builtins/*`: ambient/program producers.
- `packages/runtime/runtime.ts`: periodic tick orchestration.

## Summary

The mature online chain is:

```text
evidence -> activity/audio/visual_frame -> activity_block/proposal
  -> resource/intent/workflow/memory
  -> work_thread/work.focus_set/project.current
  -> timeline.activity/project_timeline
```

The application-facing ambient chain is also mostly live:

```text
project.current_context/thread.active_work
  -> advice.research/advice.writing_assist/opportunity.tool
  -> task.background_research/task.toolsmith_prototype
  -> draft.writing_continuation/draft.tool_prototype
  -> agent.task_list/tool.prototype_artifact
```

The less mature area is the newer ViewSpec families for project memory,
learning, durable memory subtypes, and naming aliases. Those need catalog
unification and runtime wiring before they should be treated as first-class UI
surfaces.

## Consolidation Work

Before calling this whole taxonomy "implemented", do these in order:

1. Add `state.surface`, `work.focus_set`, `project.current`, and the mature
   Spec-ready project/memory/learning types to `packages/views/catalog.ts`, or
   make HTTP catalog read from `@info/view-system` as the single source.
2. Keep aliases as compatibility metadata only:
   `research.brief` -> `brief.research`, `writing.advice` ->
   `advice.writing_assist`, `app.language.review_queue` ->
   `learning.review_queue`.
3. Decide which Spec-ready processors should run in the periodic runtime tick,
   which should stay on-demand, and which should be manual-only.
4. Update the UI group rail to read groups from catalog/spec metadata instead
   of maintaining a local fallback list.
5. Add a test that fails if a ViewSpec claims a producer but no registered
   processor/program/runtime path can produce that view type.
